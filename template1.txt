It was an average, {} day and I decided to go to the beach with {}. As we walked up to the shore, {} and I saw a sign for {}'s Discount {}. We ran up {} to get something to eat, but were shocked to find that they only sold {}. We were already there, so we bought {}. They only cost ${} each. Carrying our purchases, we made our way down to the water {}. We put on our swimwear: {} and {} with {} to accessorize. Finally, we tried to get in the ocean. Unfortunately, it was too {} for our liking, so we went home.
